# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up BrewTrip project folder and made initial commits to host repo on github. Implemented some basic functionality and the react/redux skeleton. Will work tomorrow on impementing route highlighting and selecting.

**Thoughts:** This is a fun project I have been thinking about for a while and am excited to see it take shape. Have some interesting ideas for some integrations but still next to explore the feasibility of them. Learning alot about redux and after implementing and manageing my own state via flux pattern in previous pojects, its easy to see the clear advantages to using something like redux.
