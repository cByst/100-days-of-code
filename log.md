# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up BrewTrip project folder and made initial commits to host repo on github. Implemented some basic functionality and the react/redux skeleton. Will work tomorrow on impementing route highlighting and selecting.

**Thoughts:** This is a fun project I have been thinking about for a while and am excited to see it take shape. Have some interesting ideas for some integrations but still next to explore the feasibility of them. Learning alot about redux and after implementing and manageing my own state via flux pattern in previous pojects, its easy to see the clear advantages to using something like redux.

### Day 1: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Implemented the directions panel on the BrewTrip app.  Began working on doing the brewery searching off route part. Will hopefully finish this up tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** After some trouble shooting at the moment I believe you can not draw multiple routes with different colors using the google maps api. So for the moment all routes will have to stay the same color. Will re-evaluate this at some point. Ran accross some nuances with redux actions and the interplay across reducers, hopeing to flush out the best practices on this as I finish up the app.
